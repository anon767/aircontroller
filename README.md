## What is an Air Console Game

Turn any mobile device into a game controller and put the gamescreen to your TV.
(see as an example: https://www.airconsole.com/)

## What to do

this is just an educational demonstration how to develop such game. But it can be easily extended

## How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/anon767/aircontroller.git
cd aircontroller/server
npm update
npm start
```

this will start the websocket server

you need some kind of webserver to access the screenclient/index.html and the controllerclient/index.html
